Before running the notebook, you need to install the required dependencies. You can do this by running the following command:

## Usage
To use the notebook, open it in Jupyter and follow the instructions provided. The notebook includes code for loading a sample dataset, training a machine learning model, and generating explanations using LIME and PDP.

## Explanation
The main concept used in this notebook is XAI (Explainable Artificial Intelligence), which is the practice of making machine learning models more transparent and interpretable. This is important because many machine learning models are "black boxes" that are difficult to understand and explain, which can make it hard to trust their predictions.

LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) is a technique for generating explanations for individual predictions made by a machine learning model. It works by approximating the model's behavior in the local neighborhood of the prediction, and generating a simple, interpretable model that can be used to explain the prediction.

PDP (Partial Dependence Plots) is a technique for visualizing the relationship between a feature and the predicted outcome of a machine learning model. It works by holding all other features constant and varying the feature of interest, and plotting the resulting predictions.

Together, LIME and PDP can be used to generate explanations for individual predictions and gain insights into the behavior of a machine learning model.
